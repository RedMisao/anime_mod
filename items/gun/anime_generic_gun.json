Made from laminated plastic, it gets its nickname after it's appearance, but don't let that trick you.  Custom technology, such as the weapon's targeting system compensating for the target's movement on the fly, rubber coating and a special carbon dioxide recycling system absorbing virtually all of the external recoil, and an integrated flash hider simultaneusly working as a supressor, make it a deceptively effective weapon.",
